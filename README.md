Problem Statement:
You are given a dataset where the number of study hours of students and their corresponding pass/fail status for an exam are provided. The dataset consists of the following:

A student who studied for 1 hour failed (status 0).
A student who studied for 2 hours failed (status 0).
A student who studied for 3 hours failed (status 0).
A student who studied for 4 hours passed (status 1).
A student who studied for 5 hours passed (status 1).
You are tasked with building a logistic regression model to predict whether a student will pass the exam (1) or fail the exam (0) based on the number of hours they studied.

Once you have trained the model, use it to predict the pass/fail status for students who studied for 2.5 hours and 4.5 hours.
